I wanted to have a convenient way to run Gemini CLI without the need to trash my OS with Node and it's dependencies. Easiest way was to wrap it as a Docker image.

## Supported tags and respective Dockerfile links

* [latest, 0.0.4](https://github.com/tgagor/docker-gemini-cli/blob/master/Dockerfile)

Version numbers use [SemVer](https://semver.org) and they reflect changes done in this repo - they are NOT related to Gemini CLI versioning. For example, each weekly build will rise version number on last place, meaning patch level update.
